# Infinite Scroll in React JS

This project contains two different approaches to implementing infinite scrolling in a React application:

1. **React Hooks Approach**: This approach uses React's built-in hooks, such as useReducer and useEffect, to manage the state and lifecycle of the infinite scrolling feature. <br/>It demonstrates a basic implementation of infinite scrolling without relying on external libraries or packages.

2. **React Query Approach**: 
This approach leverages the react-query library, which provides a powerful and flexible way to handle data fetching and caching. <br/>It demonstrates how to use react-query to implement infinite scrolling with automatic data fetching and caching.
